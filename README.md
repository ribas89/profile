# üë§ **Whoami**
15+ years of building software that works for most cases... and try-catching the edge ones.

In my career changelog, software development was my initial commit, is my current sprint, and will be my final release. As new lines were written, its chapters were decorated with an array of back-end and front-end languages (take a look at my 5+ year skills below). While (true), my recent roles keep looping around front-end; we can switch back to full-stack if that's the case.

# üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Skills**

**5+ years:** JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Redux, SQL, Git, Agile, Apache, Big O, CSS3, Cross-Browser Compatibility, HTML4, MariaDB, Prettier, Responsive Design, Scrum

**4 years:** CI/CD, Code Push, ESLint, PHP, Postman, React Native, Swagger, WCAG

**3 years:** Axe, Firebase, GitHub Actions, Java, macOS

**2 years:** Angular 2+, AngularJS, App Center, Django, NoSQL, SASS, Shell Script, SVN

**1 year:** AWS, Azure, C++, CMMI, Cypress, Docker, Expo, GraphQL Apollo, Jenkins, Kubernetes, MobX, MongoDB, Next.js, Python, Selenium, Visual Basic, Vue.js

# üíº **Job Experience**

## **Senior Software Engineer - Frontend** @ **Neurogram** | üìÖ **Nov 2023 - Nov 2024**

### ü§î **The Challenge**
The **React Web** project faced **permission bloat** and **fragmented dependencies**, leading to **slow setup**, **inconsistent code**, and **no shared design system**. The project also lacked support for **i18n**, **microservices**, and relied on **external hosting** with no access to a **CI/CD pipeline**.

### üìà **Results BY Actions** üí°
- Saved **hundreds of development hours** **BY** creating a **React Web design system** with reusable **components**, **hooks**, and **providers** used across multiple projects.  
- Reduced deploy time to **5 minutes** **BY** implementing a **2-click deploy system** through a centralized **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Firebase**.  
- Reduced onboarding time from **5 days to 5 minutes** **BY** streamlining the developer setup using **Vite** with just two commands: **npm install** & **npm run serve**.  
- Reduced redundancy by **400%** and decreased **project bootstrap time** **BY** unifying all frontend project builds and rules into a single **monorepo** with shared dependencies.  
- Increased code **quality** and **maintainability** **BY** taking ownership of the **PR review process** for all incoming code, ensuring adherence to **React best practices**.  
- Automated repetitive **configurations** **BY** integrating support for core features like **i18n**, **encryption**, **messaging**, and **responsiveness** in every project by default.  
- Enabled **multi-environment development** and testing **BY** designing and developing support for **microservices** and **live API mocks**.  

## **Senior Software Engineer - Frontend** @ **XTeam** | üìÖ **Sep 2022 - Jul 2023**

### ü§î **The Challenge**
Brought in to make final tweaks to the **React Native** project, but after integrating **thousands of real data entries**, critical **performance issues** emerged, including **inefficient data rendering**, **animation bottlenecks**, **navigation slowdowns**, **inconsistent design logic**, and **cross-compatibility challenges**.

### üìà **Results BY Actions** üí°
- Reduced cold startup time to **2 seconds** **BY** refactoring the **Redux Rehydration** process to avoid full app reloads and optimizing data loading by fetching only **critical data** first for immediate display, while loading non-essential data in the background.
- Improved **performance** for large datasets (**40,000+ items**) **BY** restructuring rendering logic, **optimizing** batch rendering, and implementing **list virtualization** during large data scrolls.
- Eliminated **screen artifacts** **BY** optimizing animation logic for large datasets, migrating **from hardcoded** animations **to dynamic**, data-driven animations using **React Native Reanimated** and **Moti**.
- Increased **maintainability** **BY** refactoring chained **useEffects**, removing misused hooks, and optimizing the React lifecycle, following **React best practices**.
- Accelerated development workflows and enhanced **UI/UX consistency** **BY** building **reusable** animation **components** and UI interactions that mimicked iOS-native behavior.
- Improved **scalability** **BY** implementing a consistent **component architecture** and adopting a **feature-based structure** to separate **UI** from **business logic**.
- Enhanced **multi-gesture** support and improved **user interactions** **BY** **designing** and implementing **gesture logic** and refactoring bottom-sheet navigation.
- Stabilized smooth, **bug-free** user experiences for **native features** **BY** rebuilding **native API flows** and ensuring reliable **native integrations**.
- Extended 3rd-party libraries to meet **project requirements** **BY** patching dependencies with **patch-package**, adding **fixes** and **new features**.

## **Senior Software Engineer - Frontend** @ **Riachuelo** | üìÖ **Aug 2020 - Aug 2022**

### ü§î **The Challenge**
The project aimed to **optimize HR workflows** by introducing a **faster, mobile-first solution** to replace the **outdated and cumbersome web interface**. Midway through the project, **team and design changes** necessitated **starting over from the ground up**, establishing **new development guidelines** and **scalable architecture**.

### üìà **Results BY Actions**
- Reduced app update **time** from **days** to **seconds** **BY** preloading native dependencies on the app store and using **CodePush** for hotfixes and feature updates.  
- Secured **communication** between the **React Native** app and backend systems **BY** implementing hybrid encryption with **RSA** and **AES**.  
- **Simplified** SMS retrieval, input handling, and validation **BY** developing the open-source **React Native OTP Framework**.  
- **Unified design** and implementation **BY** creating the open-source **React Native String Style** for Tailwind-inspired **class-based styling**.  
- **Automated** builds to TestFlight (iOS) and APKs (Android) **BY** creating a **CI/CD** pipeline with **Azure DevOps** and **App Center**.  
- Streamlined **data flow** across screens **BY** defining guidelines for **Redux**, **Context API**, and navigation parameters.  
- Contributed to internal tools **BY** developing **React.js web applications** using **Tailwind CSS**, **DaisyUI**, and **Axios**.
