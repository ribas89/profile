## 🧑‍💻 **About Me**
In my storybook, software development was my initial commit, is my sprint, and will be my legacy. As the commits are written, its chapters have been decorated with an array of back-end and front-end languages (I listed by time below, scroll down to check it out!). While (true), my loop role returns JavaScript in recent years, we can break back into full-stack if that's the case.
