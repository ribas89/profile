# üë§ **Whoami**
15+ years of building software that works for most cases... and try-catching the edge ones.

In my career changelog, software development was my initial commit, is my current sprint, and will be my final release. As new lines were written, its chapters were decorated with an array of back-end and front-end languages (take a look at my 5+ year skills below). While (true), my recent roles keep looping around front-end; we can switch back to full-stack if that's the case.

# üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Skills**

**5+ years:** JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Redux, SQL, Git, Agile, Apache, Big O, CSS3, Cross-Browser Compatibility, HTML4, MariaDB, Prettier, Responsive Design, Scrum

**4 years:** CI/CD, Code Push, ESLint, PHP, Postman, React Native, Swagger, WCAG

**3 years:** Axe, Firebase, GitHub Actions, Java, macOS

**2 years:** Angular 2+, AngularJS, App Center, Django, NoSQL, SASS, Shell Script, SVN

**1 year:** AWS, Azure, C++, CMMI, Cypress, Docker, Expo, GraphQL Apollo, Jenkins, Kubernetes, MobX, MongoDB, Next.js, Python, Selenium, Visual Basic, Vue.js

# üíº **Job Experience**

## **Senior Frontend Engineer** @ **Neurogram** | üìÖ **Nov 2023 - Nov 2024**

### ü§î **The Challenge**
The **React Web** project faced **permission bloat** and **fragmented dependencies**, leading to **slow setup**, **inconsistent code**, and **no shared design system**. The project also lacked support for **i18n**, **microservices**, and relied on **external hosting** with no access to a **CI/CD pipeline**.

### üìà **Results BY Actions** üí°
- Saved **hundreds of development hours** **BY** creating a **React Web design system** with reusable **components**, **hooks**, and **providers** used across multiple projects.  
- Reduced deploy time to **5 minutes** **BY** implementing a **2-click deploy system** through a centralized **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Firebase**.  
- Reduced onboarding time from **5 days to 5 minutes** **BY** streamlining the developer setup using **Vite** with just two commands: **npm install** & **npm run serve**.  
- Reduced redundancy by **400%** and decreased **project bootstrap time** **BY** unifying all frontend project builds and rules into a single **monorepo** with shared dependencies.  
- Increased code **quality** and **maintainability** **BY** taking ownership of the **PR review process** for all incoming code, ensuring adherence to **React best practices**.  
- Automated repetitive **configurations** **BY** integrating support for core features like **i18n**, **encryption**, **messaging**, and **responsiveness** in every project by default.  
- Enabled **multi-environment development** and testing **BY** designing and developing support for **microservices** and **live API mocks**.
