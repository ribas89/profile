# 👤 **Whoami**
In my 15+ year career logfile, software development was my initial commit, is my current sprint, and will be my final release. As new lines were written, its chapters were decorated with an array of back-end and front-end languages (take a look at my 5+ year skills below). While (true), my recent roles keep looping around front-end; we can switch back to full-stack if that's the case.

# 🛠️ **Technical Skills**

**5+ years:** JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Redux, SQL, Git, Agile, Apache, Big O, CSS3, Cross-Browser Compatibility, HTML4, MariaDB, Prettier, Responsive Design, Scrum

# 💼 **Job Experience**

## **Senior Frontend Engineer** @ **Neurogram** | 📅 **Nov 2023 - Nov 2024**

### 🤔 The Challenge
The project suffered from **permission bloat** and **fragmented dependencies** that caused **slow setup**, **inconsistent code**, and **no shared design system**. Projects lacked support for **i18n**, **microservices**, and infrastructure relied on **external hosting** with no access to **CI/CD**.

### 📈 Results **BY** Actions 💡

- Saved **hundreds of development hours** **BY** creating a **design system** with reusable **components**, hooks, and providers used across multiple projects.  
- Reduced deploy time to **5 minutes** **BY** implementing a **3-click deploy system** through a centralized **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Firebase**.  
- Reduced onboarding time from **5 days to 5 minutes** **BY** streamlining the developer setup to just two commands: **npm install** & **npm run serve**.  
- Reduced redundancy by **400%** and decreased **project bootstrap time** **BY** unifying all frontend projects into a single **monorepo** with shared dependencies.  
- Increased code **quality** and **maintainability** **BY** taking ownership of the **PR review process** for all incoming code, ensuring adherence to React **best practices**.  
- Automated repetitive **configurations** **BY** integrating support for core features like i18n, encryption, messaging, and responsiveness in every project by default.  
- Enabled **multi-environment development** and testing **BY** designing and developing support for **microservices** and **live API mocks**.
